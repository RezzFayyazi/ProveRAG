ProveRAG: Provenance-Driven Vulnerability Analysis with Automated Retrieval-Augmented LLMs

This repo offers ProveRAG, an LLM-powered system that emulates an analystâ€™s approach to vulnerability analysis while self-critiquing its own responses with evidence. By integrating a summarizing retrieval technique of up-to-date web data and a self-critique mechanism, ProveRAG reveals and alleviates the omission and hallucination problem of state-of-the-art LLMs.
