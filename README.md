# ProveRAG
ProveRAG: Provenance-Driven Vulnerability Analysis with Automated Retrieval-Augmented LLMs

## Overview

This repo offers ProveRAG, an LLM-powered system that emulates an analystâ€™s approach to vulnerability analysis while self-critiquing its own responses with evidence. By integrating a summarizing retrieval technique of up-to-date web data and a self-critique mechanism, ProveRAG reveals and alleviates the omission and hallucination problem of state-of-the-art LLMs. 

## Setup
Create a conda environment and install the libraries:
```python
conda create --name TTP-LLM python=3.10
conda activate TTP-LLM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
